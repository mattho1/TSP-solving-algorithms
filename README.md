# TSP-solving-algorithms

The program solves the traveling salesman problem. The program accepts data in xml format (example 5 data files added) or txt file. The program allows you to choose the algorithm that solves the traveling salesman problem. The program has five algorithms implemented:
<br/>Brute force search algorithm
<br/>Branch-and-Bound algorithm
<br/>Tabu Search algorithm
<br/>Greedy algorithm
<br/>Genetic algorithm
<br/><br/>
As a result, the program returns the shortest found path and the cost of passing this path.
